# JavaProjectRSA
University assignment on implementing the Rivest–Shamir–Adleman(RSA) algorithm.
RSA is an asymmetric cryptography algorithm. It works with 2 keys which are the public key and private key to encrypt data.\

This program takes in plaintext (readable texts) as an input, named "RSA-test" then outputs its ciphertext to "q3_output_encrypt_HEX.txt" and then back to plaintext in "q3_output_decrypt_PLAINTEXT"
